# Algorithmic-pathfinding-through-a-conflict-zone-in-Yemen

### Description:
Navigating through conflict zones poses significant risks and challenges. Using Python, this project applies the pathfinding technique Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the quickest route between "drop off" and "target" locations in a real-world conflict zone in Yemen, avoiding "enemy camps" and conflict-prone areas. Conflict data was acquired from the Cities and Armed Conflict Events (CACE) dataset (2020-2023).

### Limitations:
My analysis is simplified and assumes movement is unaffected by terrain. In practice, movement ease depends on topography, elevation, water bodies, and the presence of human-made structures such as roads, bridges, and urban areas.

### Results:
