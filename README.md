# Safe-path-mapping-using-Dijkstras-algorithm

### Description:
Navigating through conflict zones poses significant risks and challenges. Using Python, this project applies algorithmic pathfinding to identify the quickest route through a conflict zone in Yemen, avoiding "enemy camps" and conflict-prone areas, inferred from the Cities and Armed Conflict Events (CACE) dataset (2020-2023).

### Limitations:
My analysis is simplified and assumes movement is unaffected by terrain. In practice, movement ease depends on topography, elevation, water bodies, and the presence of human-made structures such as roads, bridges, and urban areas.

### Results:

**Figure 1** Optimized route through conflict zones, avoiding enemy bases. The heatmap indicates conflict intensity, and the black dotted line shows the safest path.
